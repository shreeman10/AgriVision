You are building a Results/Diagnosis Report page for AgriGuard - an AI-powered plant disease detection web application.

PROJECT CONTEXT

Frontend: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, lucide-react icons

SAMPLE REALISTIC CONTENT
Example: Early Blight Detected
Disease: Early Blight
Scientific Name: Alternaria solani
Confidence: 94%
Severity: Moderate
Crop: Tomato

Symptoms:
- Circular brown spots with concentric rings (target pattern)
- Yellowing around lesions
- Oldest leaves affected first
- Spots enlarge and coalesce over time

Immediate Actions:
1. Remove all infected lower leaves and destroy (do not compost)
2. Apply copper-based fungicide within 24 hours
3. Water at base of plants only - avoid wetting foliage
4. Space plants 24-36 inches apart for better air flow

Treatment Products:
Organic: Bonide Copper Fungicide (apply every 7-10 days)
Chemical: Chlorothalonil 720 (apply every 7 days, max 4 applications)

Expected Outcome: With prompt treatment, 70-80% of crop can be saved
Example: Healthy Leaf
Status: Healthy ✓
Confidence: 97%
Crop: Tomato

Great news! No diseases detected on this leaf.

Preventive Care:
- Continue current care practices
- Monitor weekly for early signs
- Maintain proper spacing and airflow
- Water consistently at soil level
- Remove lower leaves touching ground

Next Steps:
- Check other plants in your garden
- Keep records in your dashboard
- Schedule next inspection in 2 weeks
